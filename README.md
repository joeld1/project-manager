==
A conda poetry project manager - replacing .sh/.bat scripts with Python 
--
A collection of actions that allow you to use subprocess to create/manage conda envs, poetry projects, register ipykernels, and export Sublime Text 3 Python Build configuration settings.

Things are actively being refactored and haven't been documented and annotated. As such, method names are long and verbose for the meantime.

This package was created in order to practice replacing shell/.bat scripts with Python, and to allow me to use conda to install packages (via poetry) not available for computers with a Mac M1 chip. The Sublime Text 3 build config generator was created in order to be able to execute Python code with little performance issues I've been experiencing with my IDE. 

For some methods found in this module to work you need to have the following:

- Required
    - Conda
    - Poetry

- Optional
    - gy
        - Used for creating `.gitignore` files
    - stringcase
        - used to convert text to snake_case
    - toml
        - as a backup for parsing `.toml` files
    
## Note 
Some method names might undergo name changes as documentation is added.  

# Examples
Create a Conda Environment and Register Kernel
---
Running the following command:

    
    import sys

    from project_manager import CondaEnvManager as CEM
    
    # Don't add illegal characters or spaces
    conda_env_name = "hello_world" 
    
    # Version of python for conda env
    python_version = "3.9"
    
    CEM.create_and_init_conda_env(conda_env_name, python_version)

    sys.exit()

Execute `poetry init --no-interaction` 
---
Running the following command activates a conda env and runs `poetry init --no-interaction`:

    
    import sys

    from project_manager import PoetryProjectManager as PPM
    
    # Don't add illegal characters or spaces
    conda_env_name = "hello_world"

    # you can specify a directory or leave it as None for current directory
    poetry_proj_dir = None

    PPM.execute_poetry_init(conda_env_name,poetry_proj_dir)

    sys.exit()

Catch a `ModuleNotFoundError` and add missing module to `pypoetry.toml`
---
The following lines of code can help you add a missing module to your `pyproject.toml` file. This only works if the py script you are running is already part of a poetry project folder, and if a `poetry.toml` file is located in the directory of any parents of the .py file containing the below block of code. If a `pyproject.toml` isn't found in any parents it'll fail. 

    import sys
    from project_manager import PoetryProjectManager as PPM
    try:
        import some_local_module_with_missing_dependencies_not_found_in_your_pypoetry_toml
    except Exception as e:
        PPM.add_poetry_package_from_exception(__file__,e,ignore_version=True)

Uninstall a conda env
--- 

    import sys
    from project_manager import CondaEnvManager as CEM

    conda_env_name = "hello_world"
    rc = CEM.uninstall_conda_env(conda_env_name)
    
    assert rc == 0
    sys.exit()

Uninstall a jupyter kernel
--- 

    import sys
    from project_manager import CondaEnvManager as CEM

    kernel_name = "hello_world"
    rc = CEM.uninstall_kernel(kernel_name)
    
    assert rc == 0
    sys.exit()

Uninstall a jupyter kernel and conda env
--- 

    import sys
    from project_manager import CondaEnvManager as CEM

    conda_env_name = "hello_world"
    kernel_name = "hello_world"

    # specify 1 name
    # The default assumes that conda_env_name == kernel_name
    CEM.uninstall_conda_and_kernel(conda_env_name)

    # specify 2 names if both are different
    CEM.uninstall_conda_and_kernel(conda_env_name="hello_world",kernel_name="some_other_name")

    sys.exit()

Executing `git init`
--- 

    import sys
    from project_manager import GitProjectManager as GPM

    # None for current directory
    path_to_dir = None 

    # Otherwise specify the folder path
    path_to_dir = "path/to_some/folder"

    GPM.init_dir(path_to_dir)

    sys.exit()

(optional) Use `gy` to generate a `.gitignore` file (requires `gy`)
--
This adds the following gitignore files to the directory passed in

`git_ignores_to_add = ['dropbox', 'jetbrains', 'jupyternotebooks', 'macos', 'microsoftoffice', 'python','sublimetext', 'virtualenv', 'visualstudio', 'visualstudiocode']`



    import sys
    from project_manager import ProjectManager as PM

    path_to_proj_dir = "path/to_some/folder"
    PM.add_git_ignore_to_project(path_to_proj)



Create a Conda Env, Register Jupyter Kernel, and Init Current Directory as a Poetry Project
---
Running the following command, creates a Python 3.9 conda env, registers the jupyter kernel, and inits the current directory as a poetry project:

    
    import sys

    from project_manager import LocalProjectManager as LPM
    
    env_name = "hello_world"
    python_version = "3.9"
    
    LPM.init_curent_dir_as_a_poetry_conda_project(env_name, python_version)

    sys.exit()

## Register Python Interpreters with Sublime Text 3
Registering Any Python Interpreter with Sublime Text 3
---
If you're interested in registering any Python interpreter with Sublime Text 3, running the following block should help you do that.

    import sys

    from project_manager import SublimeBuildConfigGenerator as SBCG
    
    path_to_python_bin = "/opt/homebrew/anaconda3/envs/hello_world/bin"
    build_config_name = "hello_world" 

    SBCG.export_sublime_text_build_config(path_to_python_bin, build_config_name)

    sys.exit()

Registering a Conda Python Interpreter with Sublime Text 3
---
If you want to register a Conda env with Sublime Text 3 without looking up the path to it, then the following block should suffice.

    import sys
    
    from project_manager import SublimeBuildConfigGenerator as SBCG

    conda_env_name = "hello_world"
    SBCG.generate_sublime_text_3_build_config_from_conda_env(conda_env_name)

    sys.exit()

Sublime Text 3 - Build Config Output Path
---

After generating Sublime Text 3 build config settings. You should now be able to see a .sublime-build config in your application data folder
### Mac Users

for Mac users, the config settings will be found in:


    Users/{YOUR_USERNAME}/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/{build_config_name}.sublime-build

### PC Users
for PC users, the config settings will be found in:

    C:\Users\{YOUR_USERNAME}\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User\{build_config_name}.sublime-build
